Tic-Tac-Toe game for WDI Week 3

 I used Bootstrap, jQuery, JS, CSS, and the browser's localStorage to create this game. 

 I started by making sure I could click on one square and mark it. From there, I worked on being able to mark other squares, not repeat marks, determine winners, etc.
 Most of the gameplay is facilitated by jQuery's .click, .hasClass, .removeClass, and .addClass functions. I plan on rewriting these parts of the code to use localStorage instead. This would lower performance time. I plan on keeping jQuery where it is used for visual effects. 

 To install, simply "git clone" this repository. 

 Unsolved problems:
  - Make this page responsive for xs, sm, and md screen sizes. 
  - I should be able to toggle between black and white color scemes
  - write the logic of the gameplay by using JS objects like localStorage wherever possible.
